A skin by Jay's Arcade

Design inspired by the computer interfaces in the television series 'The Orville' by Seth MacFarlane.

This is a vertical touch screen skin (and now a pushbutton version too). This skin requires your screen to be physically rotated. If your screen doesn't look right, make sure you have selected the vertical version and not the horizontal one which is in a different folder.

An iOtero skin for Fruitbox V1 converted to Fruitbox V2 by Jay's Arcade.

This is a touch screen skin. This skin was built with the intention of your music being in Albums. To get the most out of this skin, each album should be in a it's own folder, and each folder should have a folder.jpg. The easiest way I've found to get folder.jpgs to populate your folders is to let Windows Media Player catalog your music. It automatically adds the folder.jpgs. Once that is done, you can copy the folders into you Pi's music folder or where ever you have your songs located for Fruibox to find. (Jay)

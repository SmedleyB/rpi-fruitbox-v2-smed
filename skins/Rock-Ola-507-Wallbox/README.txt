## Rock-Ola 507 Wallbox ##
Version 1.1 October 2023
by

This is my first full skin rather than adapting or editing others work.

It is based on an original Rock-Ola 507 wallbox.
There are some limitations in fruitbox that meant I was unable to mimic the actions of the original. 
Mike Kingsley the fruitbox author has been informed and may offer solutions in a future update.

However, it looks and acts very similar.

The status box messages include the normal 'Now Playing' and 'Coming Up' boxes but also includes status 'lights' similar to the original in terms of layout:
"Select Any Single" which mimics the original 507 as to when it is illuminated
"Play Queue Full" which also changes the Select Code display box from "---" to "-XX-"
"Current Mode" status box will toggle between "USER SELECT MODE" and "AUTO PLAY MODE"
"Error Mode" will display "INVALID SELECTION TRY AGAIN" or "DUPLICATE CHOICE SONG NOT ADDED" accompanied with an 'Uh-Oh' sound clip

The page turning sound and selection sounds are from recording an original 507 Wallbox.
The page turn and selection sounds do not play if a song is playing but do play on song loading.

Please feel free to use this skin for your own jukebox.

In the spirit of fruitbox your are welcome to use, adapt and alter the skin to suit your particular needs.
You may distribute it in modified form but please acknowledge the original work.

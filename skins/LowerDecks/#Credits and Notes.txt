A skin by Jay's Arcade

To enable touchscreen interface, select ..skins/LowerDecks/touch_fruitbox.cfg instead of ..skins/LowerDecks/fruitbox.cfg.

Inspired by the DWJukebox LCARS skin by Chris La Mantia.... and Star Trek of course. 

The Spectrum Analyzer design was inspired by (and copied from) the user pashaak at Deviant Art. Also much of the design of the skin was taken from there. https://www.deviantart.com/pashaak/art/1-904657400

The idea to name this theme Lower Decks was inspired by the Star Trek cartoon Lower Decks. The color pallette and some of the graphics were borrowed from www.thelcars.com. https://www.thelcars.com/themes/lower-decks.html

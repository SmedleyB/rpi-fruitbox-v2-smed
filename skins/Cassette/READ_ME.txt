Cassette Skin for Fruitbox

Loosely based on an old compact cassette player from decades agoight

This skin is compatible with Touchscreen or buttons

The default fruitbox.cfg file is for Touchscreens. 
The non-touch 'Button' version is 'button_fruitbox.cfg'

The touch screen operation is by 'TouchSong' - just touch the title strip 
to choose and play a song, no other input is required.

The rest of the operations should be obvious.

There are additional 'background.png' :
'no_cassette_background.png' if you want just an empty cassette door
'black_vu_background.png' if you want a black background for the vu display
If you dont want the VU display jut comment out or edit it out in the .cfg file


Touchscreen Only :

To quit to desktop - Touch the centre hinge at the top

To perform a Safe Shutdown - Touch the 'EJECT' logo on the cassette door
